```
1. Load up your PyCharm/VSCode
2. Install the requirements.txt
3. Open the terminal and type: "Uvicorn main:app --reload" to get the localhost running.
4. Execute the Main.py and download other API Calls to do GET, PUT Requests.
5. Cross verify to check whether the requests are going through and the server is running.
5. Done!
```
